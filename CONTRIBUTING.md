#Contribution Guide

We couldn't build the **ArCYive** without contributions from ISU students who are making it through college right now. Every part of the **ArCYive** is made by ISU students for ISU students. 

So, if you see something you'd like to add or fix, here's how:

1. Clone the **ArCYive**'s Hub:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/arcyive/hub.git
  ```
  
2. Make your addition or fix, using our [style guide](https://github.com/arcyive/hub/STYLE.md).
3. Push your fork:
   ```bash
   git commit -am '<descriptive commit message>'
   git push origin master
   ```
   
4. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/arcyive/hub/compare) with a description of your changes.

We'll then take a look at your contribution and leave comments or merge the request!
