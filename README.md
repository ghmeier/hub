#The ArCYive Hub

The central resource to Tech studetnts and clubs at Iowa State.

##Overview

We've been there. You're trying to finish your 228 homework, but can't find information on Binary Search Trees anywhere. Maybe you're trying to reserve a room for your club's overnight hack sesh but can't figure out where to go to reserve the room. It's tough enough to make it through classes without having to go digging through pages of search results or into the depths of ISU's website just to get started. 

Since we're all in this together, we created the **ArCYive** to help you through the struggle of college life in Tech. The **ArCYive** is a collection of resources we've found useful to successfully navigating ISU, and we want to let you in on it.

##What's Here?
